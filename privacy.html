          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <h3>Last update: 2018-03-01</h3>
          <p></p>
        </div>
        
<p>We at msgblocks (“msgblocks,” “we,” or “us”) believe that your privacy is a fundamental right. We have written this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to reflect our values, and to clearly describe what information we collect from you when you use our specially-developed smart contracts to write your messages to the Ethereum blockchain, which can then be visualized on a website (www.msgblocks.com) that users can interact with (the “Site”). The smart contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “App”. By using the App, you agree that we can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this Policy. This Policy only applies to the App, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via the App. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.</p>

<p>The App might evolve over time, and this Policy will change to reflect that evolution. If we make changes, we will update the date of the last revision at the top of this page, so that you know that something has changed since the last time you read it. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices. In some cases, if we make significant changes, we may give you additional notice by adding a statement to our homepage. </p>

<div class="section-heading">
    <h3>Information Collection</h3>
</div>

<p><b>First and foremost, this app is fully-distributes, which means msgblocks doesn't have a custom back-end or database. It is basically just a front-end to the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we don't directly collect any of your data and don't store it outsite of the blockchain. Remember that the blockchain is public, so the messages you write will be public as well and stored on thousands of computers around the worls. They would be easily retrievable with a blockchain transaction explorer, and although you can obfuscate them with a password, the encrypted data will still be easily retrievable.</b></p>

<p>In order to save a message to the blockchain, you will need to use your Ethereum wallet through the MetaMask browser plugin. The Site will know what your wallet address is, but will not record it outside of the blockchain. The Site also asks for your name, as an optional information that will be stored on the blockchain together with your message. However, that can be any name you want to have associated to your message, it can be a nickname or some other form of identification, and you can also not provide one at all. In case you do provide that information, we will not record it outside of the blockchain anyway (just like for the wallet address).</p>

<p>To reiterate, we do not collect any other personally-identifiable information about you, unless you give it to us directly: by giving us written feedback, communicating with us via third party social media sites, or otherwise communicating with us via the App or any other means. We do not collect any payment information from you, other than your Ethereum wallet address.</p>

<p>We do however collect basic analytics when you use the App. This sort of information may be collected from third-party providers like Facebook or Google Analytics, and includes, among other things, the type of device you use, access times, IP address, hardware model, operating system and version, and other unique device identifiers. Some of these third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use the App might be affected.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
    <h3>Information Usage</h3>
</div>

<p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To analyze trends for how the App is being used;
<li>To improve the App;</li>
<li>To help personalize your experience of the App; and</li>
<li>We may share the information we collect with third parties who need to access it in order to do work on our behalf, including doing things like helping us make the App available, or providing analytics services for us.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not share any information that directly identifies you with any third party, except in the following limited cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>As required to comply with applicable law or regulation, or to comply with law enforcement;</li>
<li>To respond to claims and/or legal process;</li>
<li>To protect our rights or our property, or to enforce our terms of service;</li>
<li>To prevent behavior that is (or that we think may be) illegal or unethical;</li>
<li>To prevent behavior that is (or that we think may be) illegal or unethical;</li>
<li>With your consent, or at your request or direction; or</li>
<li>As otherwise set forth in this Policy.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-heading">
    <h3>Information Processing</h3>
</div>

<p>Depending on where you are located, your information may need to be transferred to different servers around the world as part of using the App. You acknowledge that, as part of making the App available to you, we may transfer your information to or maintain your information on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of Europe and you choose to provide your information to us, you agree that we have the right to transfer your information to Europe and process it there. By using the App, or by otherwise providing any information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of that information in and to Europe.</p>


<div class="section-heading">
    <h3>Information Security</h3>
</div>

<p>As mentioned in the "Information Collection" section, we don't store the data and messages you submit on this Site on our own databases, and the Site is just a front-end to the <b>Ethereum blockchain, which is public by definition</b>. Analytics data stored by 3rd party sites like Facebook or Google Analytics is subject to those services' security policies, and we suggest you refer to them directly. With that in mind, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
    <h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3>
</div>

<p>The App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and you become aware that your child has provided personally identifiable information to us without your and their consent, contact us at msgblocks@gmail.com. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with their personally identifiable information, we will remove that information from our files.</p>
